# Railway-Reservation-System-MERN-stack
Design and develop a Railway Reservation System for booking tickets, managing schedules, and processing payments for railway services. The system should allow users to search for available trains, book tickets, and make secure payments, while administrators can manage train schedules, ticket availability, and track bookings.
